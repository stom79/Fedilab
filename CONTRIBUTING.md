CONTRIBUTING
============

### Localizations:

Fedilab works only with [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fedilab), which offers nice
tools for helping in translations. New translations will be automatically merged in a branch.

If you're submiting a merge request and your work adds new strings to the app, make sure they only
exist in the default strings.xml file (res/values/strings.xml). If you add or modify strings of
other languages, it will interfere with weblate's translations.

### Issues and Reports:

Before creating an issue please take a moment and search the repository issues to avoid duplicates.
For bug reports, please provide as much details as possible to better debug the problem. The
important part is how to reproduce the bug and steps to reproduce it.

### Pull Requests

Please target the develop branch and not the main branch.
